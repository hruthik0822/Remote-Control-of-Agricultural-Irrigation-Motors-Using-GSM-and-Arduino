Remote Control of Agricultural Irrigation Motors Using GSM and Arduino
This project, developed at Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, provides a cost-effective and reliable system for farmers to remotely control agricultural irrigation motors using simple SMS commands. It eliminates the need for physical presence, saves time, conserves water, and is ideal for rural areas where internet connectivity is limited.

üìç The Problem
In traditional agriculture, farmers must travel to their fields, often over long distances, simply to switch irrigation pumps on or off. This manual process is inefficient, labor-intensive, and leads to wasted water and increased operational costs. There is a need for an accessible and affordable remote control solution to modernize these practices.

‚ú® Key Features
SMS-Based Control: Operate the irrigation motor from any standard mobile phone via text messages.

No Internet Required: Relies on the widely available GSM cellular network.

Real-Time Status Updates: The system provides status updates via the onboard LCD screen and can be configured to send confirmation SMS messages.

Low-Cost and Accessible: Built with affordable and readily available components like Arduino and a SIM800L module.

Scalable: The platform can be expanded with additional sensors and features.

‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture and Design
The system is centered around an Arduino Uno, which acts as the brain. It processes commands received by the GSM module and controls a relay switch connected to the water pump.

Circuit Diagram
The circuit connects the Arduino Uno to the SIM800L module for communication, a 16x2 LCD display for status messages, and a 5V relay module to safely switch the high-voltage water pump.

System Flow
The program logic waits for an incoming SMS. It parses the message to check for valid commands ("Motor ON", "Motor OFF", etc.) and then triggers the appropriate action.
